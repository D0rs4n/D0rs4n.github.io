# What's surprised me about Machine learning? ðŸ˜®

### Some backstory before I dive into details... ðŸ˜‰
When I first came across Machine Learning, my first impression was that.. WOW ðŸ˜¬.. I need a lot of Maths for this, and that maybe I should **avoid** it ðŸ˜…, since I was **quite bad** at Maths that time.
So.. I waited... Until the March of 2020, when I discovered the Machine Learning course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).(It's a really great online platform to learn programming) So.. I thought that was time..
For the record, I was still so bad at Maths back then, but I didn't care about that ðŸ˜…, I just wanted to learn something new, create something new. (I ended up creating a Dog/Cat Classifier with a 50% accuracy, mostly because I didn't pay attention to the Maths behind the algorithms, but that's a story for another day.ðŸ˜Ž)
So, after about a month I felt like this whole *"AI thingy"* would never work without Maths, so I started to concentrate more on python and intermediate-advanced coding conventions, that later led to a competition.
However, after a year when I was watching the wonderful series called Sillicon Valley, I thought maybe I should start learning about Deep Learning again.. 
I had gotten a bit better in Maths by then, so in theory I had the "mathematical background". I was a bit lost where to start, then I came across the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/ "Course home page") course, and it changed everything.

## And finally.. what's really surprised me..
The fact.. that you don't need to have a PhD from Maths, that.. there's no need to spend years with studying advanced Maths at a fancy University. 
Yes.. ðŸ˜± It's surprised me too.. So I dove into the course mentioned below, I had so much fun with creating models(finally with a better accuracy... )
I also discovered [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) that was a huge help for learning additional Maths.
